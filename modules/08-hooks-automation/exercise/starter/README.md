# Module 08 Starter Code

## Files
- `settings.json` — Claude Code hooks configuration (the entry point)
- `scripts/` — hook scripts (read stdin JSON, exit with allow/deny semantics)
- `sample-code/` — small files to test your hooks against

## Tip
Keep your hooks fast and scoped (matchers + path filters) so they stay usable.
