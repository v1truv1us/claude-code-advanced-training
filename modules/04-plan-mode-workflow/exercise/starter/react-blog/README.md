# React Blog Starter (for Module 04)

This is a *minimal* example codebase used by the Module 04 Plan Mode exercise.

It intentionally includes a very basic comments system backed by `localStorage` so the exercise has something real to explore and plan around.

## Quick start
```bash
npm test
```

## Key files
- `src/services/commentsStore.js` — current localStorage-backed comment persistence
- `src/components/Comments.jsx` — UI-level comment list + composer
- `src/models/comment.js` — simple comment shape

## Notes
- This is not intended to be a full React app build; it’s an artifact for exploration/planning.
