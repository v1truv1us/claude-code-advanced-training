# Module 06 Starter Artifacts

This module’s exercises are about creating more robust skills (with supporting files) and thinking through distribution.

## Files
- `knowledge-skill-template.md` — starter template for a knowledge/reference skill
- `workflow-mapping-template.md` — template for capturing a repeatable workflow
- `team-distribution-template.md` — template for planning rollout + maintenance
- `tech-stack-analysis.md` — prompts/checklist for analyzing your stack

## Output
You’ll ultimately create skills under:
- `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
