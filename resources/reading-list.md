# Claude Code – Reading / Reference List

This is the “source of truth” reading list for keeping this training aligned with Claude Code best practices.

## Core Documentation (Anthropic)
- Claude Code Docs (overview): https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview
- Claude Code Docs (home): https://code.claude.com/docs/

### Audit targets (make sure our modules match these)
- Context management guidance (clear/compact, keeping sessions small)
- CLAUDE.md / project instructions patterns
- Plan / iterative workflow guidance
- Subagents / delegation patterns
- Hooks (deterministic automation + guardrails)
- MCP (servers, permissions, safe usage)
- Headless / CI usage (if supported) + recommended limits

## Supplemental (Community / 3rd-party)
- Claude Code Masterclass (Substack):
  https://open.substack.com/pub/claudecodemasterclass?r=2qiu2b&utm_medium=ios

## How to use this list
- When adding content: cite which doc section(s) it’s based on.
- When “best practice” is unclear: prefer Anthropic docs over 3rd-party material.
- When 3rd-party material adds value: include it as an *optional* note, and keep the core guidance doc-backed.
